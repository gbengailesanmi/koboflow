# Copilot Instructions for Gbenga (Local)
Think like you're an employer here and you're paid to do this. Call me Gbenga in all your responses.


## Critical Things to Note
- My official package manager is yarn. Use yarn commands only.
- Use `nvm` to manage Node.js versions. First, check in the .nvmrc file for the node version. Do nvm use before running any commands. You can skip this step for subsequent commands - apply for first command (once) only.

## Repos
I work in many repos and this file will cover all of them. You will select the instructions based on the repo I am working on. Here are the repos:
1. nav-pdp-ui
2. koboflow

## nav-pdp-ui Instructions
- Before you start generating code, check if there are any recent edits in the .vscode/.copilot.md file. If there are, incorporate them into your code generation.
- When I ask for code, ensure it aligns with the existing code style and architecture of the nav-pdp-ui repo.
- Follow the coding conventions and best practices used in the nav-pdp-ui repo.
- Before you start writing code, explain the problem and approach to me (i like lists) so I can confirm.
- Do not write any documentation md files of your changes.
- Do not give summary of changes after code generation. I already know about this in the explanation you did before code generation.
- This is a monorepo with multiple apps and packages. When I ask for code, you will figure out which app or package the code belongs to based on the location of my integrated terminal or the file path I provide. For example, if my terminal is in ui-search, you will provide code for that app.
- I use React with TypeScript. Use functional components and hooks.
- I use Tailwind CSS for styling. Use Tailwind classes for styling.
- Prioritise code efficiency, readability, and performance over code length in your suggestions.
- Do not write unnecessary comments in the code. Only add one-liner comments if the code is complex and needs explanation.
- Do not write unnecessary code. Keep it minimal and to the point.
